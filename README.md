## Installation

Choose **one** of the following methods: **pip** or **uv**.

### pip

> We recommend using a fresh virtual environment (e.g., `conda`, `venv`, etc.) to avoid conflicts.

**Step 1**: Install PyTorch

<details>
<summary>NVIDIA GPU</summary>

```bash
# Install pytorch with your CUDA version, e.g.
pip install torch==2.8.0+cu128 torchaudio==2.8.0+cu128 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
```
> See [PyTorch official site](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for other versions installation.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Apple Silicon</summary>

```bash
pip install torch==2.8.0 torchaudio==2.8.0
```

</details>

**Step 2**: Install OmniVoice (choose one)

```bash
# From PyPI (stable release)
pip install omnivoice

# From the latest source on GitHub (no need to clone)
pip install git+https://github.com/k2-fsa/OmniVoice.git

# For development (clone first, editable install)
git clone https://github.com/k2-fsa/OmniVoice.git
cd OmniVoice
pip install -e .
```

### uv

Clone the repository and sync dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/k2-fsa/OmniVoice.git
cd OmniVoice
uv sync
```

> **Tip**: Can use mirror with `uv sync --default-index "https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple"`

---

## Quick Start

Try OmniVoice without coding:

- Launch the local web UI: `omnivoice-demo --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 8001`

- Or try it directly on [HuggingFace Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/k2-fsa/OmniVoice)

- Or run it in Google Colab: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/k2-fsa/OmniVoice/blob/master/docs/OmniVoice.ipynb)

> If you have trouble connecting to HuggingFace when downloading the pre-trained models, set `export HF_ENDPOINT="https://hf-mirror.com"` before running.

For full usage, see the [Python API](#python-api) and [Command-Line Tools](#command-line-tools) sections below.

---

## Python API

OmniVoice supports three generation modes. All features in this section are also available via [command-line tools](#command-line-tools).

### Voice Cloning

Clone a voice from a short reference audio. Provide `ref_audio` and `ref_text`:

```python
from omnivoice import OmniVoice
import soundfile as sf
import torch

model = OmniVoice.from_pretrained(
    "k2-fsa/OmniVoice",
    device_map="cuda:0",
    dtype=torch.float16
)
# Apple Silicon users: use device_map="mps" instead

audio = model.generate(
    text="Hello, this is a test of zero-shot voice cloning.",
    ref_audio="ref.wav",
    ref_text="Transcription of the reference audio.",
) # audio is a list of `np.ndarray` with shape (T,) at 24 kHz.

# If you don't want to input `ref_text` manually, you can directly omit the `ref_text`.
# The model will use Whisper ASR to auto-transcribe it.

sf.write("out.wav", audio[0], 24000)
```

> **Tips**
>
> - Use a 3–10 seconds reference audio clip. Longer audio slows down inference and may degrade cloning quality.
> - For standard pronunciation, use a reference audio in the **same language** as the target speech. In cross-lingual voice cloning (i.e., the reference audio and target speech are in different languages), the generated speech will carry an accent from the reference audio's language.
> - For better results with Arabic numerals, normalize them to words first (e.g., "123" → "one hundred twenty-three") with text normalization tools (e.g., [WeTextProcessing](https://github.com/wenet-e2e/WeTextProcessing)).
>
> For more tips, see [docs/tips.md](docs/tips.md).

### Voice Design

Describe the desired voice with speaker attributes — no reference audio needed.
Supported attributes: **gender** (male/female), **age** (child to elderly),
**pitch** (very low to very high), **style** (whisper), **English accent**
(American, British, etc.), and **Chinese dialect** (四川话, 陕西话, etc.).
Attributes are comma-separated and freely combinable across categories.

```python
audio = model.generate(
    text="Hello, this is a test of zero-shot voice design.",
    instruct="female, low pitch, british accent",
)
```

> **Note**: Voice design was trained on Chinese and English data only. It can generalize to other languages, but results can be unstable for some low-resource languages.

See [docs/voice-design.md](docs/voice-design.md) for the full attribute
reference, Chinese equivalents, and usage tips.

### Auto Voice

Let the model choose a voice automatically:

```python
audio = model.generate(text="This is a sentence without any voice prompt.")
```

### Generation Parameters

All above three modes share the same `model.generate()` API. You can further control the generation behavior via keyword arguments:

```python
audio = model.generate(
    text="...",
    num_step=32,  # diffusion steps (or 16 for faster inference)
    speed=1.0,     # speed factor (>1.0 faster, <1.0 slower)
    duration=10.0, # fixed output duration in seconds (overrides speed)
    # ... more options
)
```
See more detailed control in [docs/generation-parameters.md](docs/generation-parameters.md).

### Non-Verbal & Pronunciation Control

OmniVoice supports inline **non-verbal symbols** and **pronunciation correction** within the input text.

**Non-verbal symbols**: Insert tags like `[laughter]` directly in the text to add expressive non-verbal sounds.

```python
audio = model.generate(text="[laughter] You really got me. I didn't see that coming at all.")
```

Supported tags: `[laughter]`, `[sigh]`, `[confirmation-en]`, `[question-en]`, `[question-ah]`, `[question-oh]`, `[question-ei]`, `[question-yi]`, `[surprise-ah]`, `[surprise-oh]`, `[surprise-wa]`, `[surprise-yo]`, `[dissatisfaction-hnn]`.

**Pronunciation control (Chinese)**: Use pinyin with tone numbers to correct specific character pronunciations.

```python
audio = model.generate(text="这批货物打ZHE2出售后他严重SHE2本了，再也经不起ZHE1腾了。")
```

**Pronunciation control (English)**: Use [CMU pronunciation dictionary](https://svn.code.sf.net/p/cmusphinx/code/trunk/cmudict/cmudict.0.7a)  (uppercase, in brackets) to override default English pronunciations.

```python
audio = model.generate(text="He plays the [B EY1 S] guitar while catching a [B AE1 S] fish.")
```

## Command-Line Tools

Three CLI entry points are provided. The CLI tools support all features available in the Python API (voice cloning, voice design, auto voice, generation parameters, etc.) — all controlled via command-line arguments.

| Command | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `omnivoice-demo` | Interactive Gradio web demo | [omnivoice/cli/demo.py](omnivoice/cli/demo.py) |
| `omnivoice-infer` | Single-item inference | [omnivoice/cli/infer.py](omnivoice/cli/infer.py) |
| `omnivoice-infer-batch` | Batch inference across multiple GPUs | [omnivoice/cli/infer_batch.py](omnivoice/cli/infer_batch.py) |

### Demo

```bash
omnivoice-demo --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 8001
```

Provides a web UI for voice cloning and voice design. See `omnivoice-demo --help` for all options.

### Single Inference

```bash
# Voice Cloning
# ref_text can be omitted (Whisper will auto-transcribe ref_audio to get it).
omnivoice-infer \
    --model k2-fsa/OmniVoice \
    --text "This is a test for text to speech." \
    --ref_audio ref.wav \
    --ref_text "Transcription of the reference audio." \
    --output hello.wav

# Voice Design
omnivoice-infer --model k2-fsa/OmniVoice \
    --text "This is a test for text to speech." \
    --instruct "male, British accent" \
    --output hello.wav

# Auto Voice
omnivoice-infer \
    --model k2-fsa/OmniVoice \
    --text "This is a test for text to speech."\
    --output hello.wav
```

### Batch Inference

`omnivoice-infer-batch` can distribute batch inference across multiple GPUs, designed for large-scale TTS tasks.

```bash
omnivoice-infer-batch \
    --model k2-fsa/OmniVoice \
    --test_list test.jsonl \
    --res_dir results/
```

The test list is a JSONL file where each line is a JSON object:
```json
{"id": "sample_001", "text": "Hello world", "ref_audio": "/path/to/ref.wav", "ref_text": "Reference transcript", "instruct": "female, british accent", "language_id": "en", "duration": 10.0, "speed": 1.0}
```
Only `id` and `text` are mandatory fields. `ref_audio` and `ref_text` are used in voice cloning mode. `instruct` is used in voice design mode. If no reference audio or instruct are provided, the model will generate text in a random voice.

`language_id`, `duration`, and `speed` are optional. `duration` (in seconds) fixes the output length; `speed` controls the speaking rate. If `duration` and `speed` are both provided, `speed` will be ignored.
